Creating a feed forward neural network from scratch and testing it

What is a Feed forward Neural Network(FNN)?

  A Feedforward Neural Network is an artificial neural network wherein connections between the nodes do not form a cycle.  
  The feedforward neural network was the first and simplest type of artificial neural network devised.
  
  In this network, the information moves in only one direction, forward, from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any) and to     the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network.
